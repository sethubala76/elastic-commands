JVM Checks
--------------
heap size
disable swapping
not use serial collector
OnError and OnOutOfMemoryError
G1GC
server JVM

Linux Checks
--------------
maximum map count
maximum size virtual memory
maximum number of threads
file descriptor
system call filter

Heap size
----------
jvm.options
-Xms2g
-Xmx2g

Commandline : ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms2g -Xmx2g" bin/elasticsearch

Not use serial collector
--------------------------
‒ ensures that Elasticsearch is not configured to run with the serial garbage collector

Disable swapping
-------------------------
‒ configure the JVM to lock the heap in memory using mlockall (Linux) or virtual lock (Windows)
‒ If bootstrap.memory_lock is true, ES will verify locking

GET _nodes/process

OnError and OnOutOfMemoryError
--------------------------------
‒ To pass this check, do not enable OnError nor OnOutOfMemoryError in our JVM options
‒ instead, upgrade to Java 8u92+ and use the JVM flag ExitOnOutOfMemoryError

G1GC
----
‒ the G1GC garbage collector can not be enabled on versions of the JDK prior to JDK8u40 (and is not recommended anyway)

Server JVM
-----------
‒ OpenJDK has a client JVM and a server JVM
‒ you must start Elasticsearch with the server VM

Linux Checks
============
Maximum map count
‒ you must configure vm.max_map_count via sysctl to be at least 262,144
Maximum size virtual memory
‒ configure your system to allow the Elasticsearch process the ability to have unlimited address space
‒ set “as” to “unlimited” in /etc/security/limits.conf
Maximum number of threads
‒ configure your system to allow the Elasticsearch process the ability to create at least 2,048 threads
‒ set the proc setting in /etc/security/limits.conf
File descriptor
‒ increase the limit on the number of open files descriptors for the user running Elasticsearch to 65,536 or higher
‒ set ulimit -n 65536, or set nofile to 65536 in /etc/security/limits.conf
GET _cat/nodes?v&h=name,file_desc.max
System call filter
‒ either fix any configuration errors on your system that prevented system call filters from installing
‒ or, at your own risk disable system call filters by setting bootstrap.system_call_filter to false
