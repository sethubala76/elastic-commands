But what should you do when you see shards lingering in an UNASSIGNED state?
[https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/elasticsearch-unassigned-shards/#reason-1-shard-allocation-is-purposefully-delayed]
1. Shard allocation is purposefully delayed
2. Too many shards, not enough nodes
3. You need to re-enable shard allocation
4. Shard data no longer exists in the cluster
5. Low disk watermark
6. Multiple Elasticsearch versions

curl -XGET localhost:9200/_cat/shards?h=index,shard,prirep,state,unassigned.reason| grep UNASSIGNED
