But what should you do when you see shards lingering in an UNASSIGNED state?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/elasticsearch-unassigned-shards/#reason-1-shard-allocation-is-purposefully-delayed]
1. Shard allocation is purposefully delayed
2. Too many shards, not enough nodes
3. You need to re-enable shard allocation
4. Shard data no longer exists in the cluster
5. Low disk watermark
6. Multiple Elasticsearch versions
-----------------------------------------------
curl -XGET localhost:9200/_cat/shards?h=index,shard,prirep,state,unassigned.reason| grep UNASSIGNED

If youâ€™re running version 5+ of Elasticsearch
curl -XGET localhost:9200/_cluster/allocation/explain?pretty

curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/index_name/'
------------------------------------------------
Reason 1: Shard allocation is purposefully delayed
[TIMESTAMP][INFO][cluster.routing] [MASTER NODE NAME] delaying allocation for [54] unassigned shards, next check in [1m]

You can dynamically modify the delay period like so:
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/<INDEX_NAME>/_settings' -d 
'{
	"settings": {
	   "index.unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout": "30s"
	}
}

Note:- Replacing <INDEX_NAME> with _all for all indecies in your cluster
-------------------------------------------------------------
Reason 2: Too many shards, not enough nodes

N >= R + 1

curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/<INDEX_NAME>/_settings' -d '{"number_of_replicas": 2}'

Reason 3: You need to re-enable shard allocation
Note:- Shard allocation is enabled by default on all nodes, but you may have disabled shard allocation at some point (for example, in order to perform a rolling restart), and forgotten to re-enable it.
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_cluster/settings' -d
'{ "transient":
    { "cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "all" 
    }
}'
